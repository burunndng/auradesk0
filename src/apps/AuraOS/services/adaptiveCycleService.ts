  const prompt = `## ROLE
You are an expert facilitator of the Adaptive Cycle framework from systems ecology and resilience theory (C.S. Holling). You help people map their life situations onto this powerful four-phase model.

## TASK
Generate a complete four-quadrant Adaptive Cycle map for the user's specific system. Each quadrant should contain 3-5 concrete, specific bullet points that describe how that phase manifests in THEIR situation.

## USER'S SYSTEM
"${systemToAnalyze}"${hintContext}

## CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS
- **BE SPECIFIC** to the user's system ("${systemToAnalyze}"), not generic
- **DO NOT use placeholders** like "[user's situation]" or "[their context]"
- **REFERENCE their actual words** from their system description
- Each bullet point should be actionable, concrete, or descriptive of their specific situation
- Generate meaningful content for ALL FOUR quadrants, even if one seems most relevant

## THE FOUR PHASES

**r - Growth / Exploitation (High Potential, Low Connectedness)**
- Rapid growth, experimentation, abundance
- Few constraints, high energy for new initiatives
- Innovation and expansion dominate

**K - Conservation (High Potential, High Connectedness)**
- Mature, stable, efficient, optimized
- Highly interconnected and productive, but rigid
- Vulnerability to disruption due to locked-in patterns

**Ω - Release / Collapse (Low Potential, High Connectedness)**
- Breakdown of old structures
- Chaos, uncertainty, letting go
- Resources being freed for recombination

**α - Reorganization (Low Potential, Low Connectedness)**
- Space for experimentation and emergence
- Renewal, innovation, recombination
- New patterns forming from released resources
